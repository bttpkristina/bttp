                "<p class='mt-2 text-xl text-gray-600 font-bold font-timesnewroman'>1. Complexity of Choice</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>If you find yourself distracted by feelings and thoughts involving the multitude of choices or decisions you must make—</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Acknowledge first that life should be simpler, as it was just 100 years ago when we felt blessed to simply have food, shelter, safety, and someone to love. The vast amount of choices we have—for everything from television stations, cereal selections in the grocery store, to flavors of coffee at our favorite barista—are simply overwhelming.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>The sheer number of choices is creating a tremendous amount of anxiety for us. This suffering is the type of anxiety that comes from our <span class='italic'>complexity of choice</span>. When these feelings and thoughts occupy our consciousness, we can’t enjoy the moment we are in. They rob us, consuming vast amounts of our limited time and energy.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>We have convinced ourselves that somehow, among all the varied choices we have, one will stand out as simply the best—hopefully, making us the happiest. Stop and think: our ancestors had little in the way of choice. When food, shelter and safety were threatened, anxiety was provoked to meet those life-sustaining needs. In that time, anxiety was a powerfully profound motivational tool used to satisfy simple needs.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Today however, this complexity of choice makes decision-making laborious. Decisions become confoundingly difficult when it comes to satisfying what it is we <span class='font-semibold italic'>want</span>, not <span class='font-semibold italic'>need</span>. Why? Because we just keep creating more and more to want for ourselves. We have proven our imagination, creativity, curiosity and competitiveness to be insatiable.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Ask yourself: <span class='italic'>What is it that brings joy in your life?</span> It is not the temporary and fleeting nature of happiness. Happiness may bring a smile to our face, but it fades. There is always going to be something more to want.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>No, what we desire most is the <span class='font-semibold'>joy that comes from good, loving relationships with others.</span> Simplify your choices to those that satisfy your truest desires, and watch your anxiety lessen.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>If you find yourself distracted by too many choices—acknowledge that humanity has created endless possibilities, exhausting our minds. From peanut butter to television channels, our complexity of choice overwhelms.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Somehow, we believe if we have what we want, we’ll be happy—only to discover joy doesn’t come from satisfying wants. That chase is insatiable. True joy comes from relationships.</p>" +
                
                "<p class='mt-2 text-xl text-gray-600 font-bold font-timesnewroman'>2. Future Perceptions</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>If you find yourself distracted by feelings and thoughts about the future—</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'><span class='font-semibold'>Remember:</span> as hard as we may try, we were not given the ability to predict the future. When these thoughts occupy our consciousness, we cannot enjoy the moment we are in.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>We often create anticipatory fears and expectations that are rarely as bad—or as good—as we imagine. We overwhelm ourselves with obsessive preparedness.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Think about the best things and worst things that have happened in your life. They usually came as complete surprises. Stop wasting time and energy on future perceptions.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'><span class='font-semibold'>Be clear:</span> what you truly desire is good relationships with those you love. Start making one decision at a time with this intention, and see your future joy increase.</p>" +

                "<p class='mt-2 text-xl text-gray-600 font-bold font-timesnewroman'>3. Past Burdens</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>If you find yourself distracted by feelings and thoughts about the past—</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Acknowledge that the suffering you experienced cannot be changed. When you let these thoughts occupy your consciousness, you struggle to enjoy the present.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>These feelings exist only in your mind. They are unique to you, unavailable to anyone else in the same way. We humans never forget suffering—but that memory is not meant just to make us suffer.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Instead, past experiences are <span class='font-semibold italic'>teaching tools</span>. They remind us of choices that created suffering, and help us avoid repeating them.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Regret, guilt, shame—these distract us from joy. But forgiveness is not an emotion; it is a <span class='font-semibold'>commitment</span> to yourself to stop reliving past suffering.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Once you forgive, you can use that knowledge wisely—to plan and create a better life for yourself and those you love.</p>" +

                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Acknowledge your frustration, disappointment, or resentment. Maybe even anger, contempt, or hatred you hold towards someone—or believe they hold towards you.</p>" +
                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>When these feelings consume us, we cannot enjoy the present.</p>" +

                "<p class='mt-2 ml-2 text-gray-600 font-timesnewroman text-xl'>Now, ask yourself what you can do better next time. Work on what you alone can change, and release what you cannot control.</p>" +
